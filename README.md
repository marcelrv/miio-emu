# miio-emu
Xiaomi Mi IO device emulator

This is emulating various Xiaomi devices, to support development of alternative control programs

note: device responses are currently hardcoded in FakeResponses.java or coded per device in the device specific json file

Note to run, I use Eclipse, right click EmulatorMain and select 'run as' -> 'Java Application'
